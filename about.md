Hello, world!  This is Andrew Yaspan and I am creating my first blog (and jekyll page).  This should be a great way to connect with people, share my thoughts and learn!  You can learn how to make your own page here: [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at: [github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)
