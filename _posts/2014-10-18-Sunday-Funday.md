    {{ content }} Good day, web viewers.  I have been messing around with this jekyll site all morning and I finally feel like I am getting somewhere.  The Saints game is on in the background as I am writing.  The Saints are currently winning 17-10 against the Lions.  I also hope to work on my CS50 assignments.  I think I am getting closer to finishing the PSet 5 assignment Resize and I have already begun to break down and and write pseudocode for the recover assignment.  I may also do some research and testing for my Communit-Police Mediation website project for the Independent Police Monitor.  Let the day continue!
