    <p> People are thoughtful ore careful about their words when the idea that sensitivity towards a particular group of class of people becomes in vogue, but why can't people learn from history to see that we generally aren't sensative enough to those who are marginalized by both natural and man-made circumstances.  Categorizing makes things neat and simple, but it also demeans and strips people, places, or things of their intrinsic and complex value/beauty.
    
    I was certainly surprized to hear Juvenile Court Judge candidates refer to children as people with "mental problems" or potentially a "lost cause."  Beyond that I routinely discover that there are new phrases to describe poor young people with a personal history of trauma or cognitive disorder, especially when they are of color. "At risk," "underpriveleged," "underserved," "disconnected," and lately "opportunity."  I don't take issue with the fact that people in the juvenile justice, education, and public health communities have come up with less pejorative and politically correct names for these youngers, but I do take issue with the fact that once such communities adopt a new term the circumstances poor young men and women endure become  trivialized.  When routinely referred to as people of a simple "at-risk," "underpriveleged," or "opportuntiy" status, I consequently find myself thinking of such youth as passive.  Passive young men and women whose lives are to be determined based on the hopefullness or hopelessness others feel about their prospects at getting a job, finding a passion, and successfully raising a family.  And maybe that's my problem, but I generally find that I'm not alone.  The sad thing to me is, the passivity ascribed to these young men and women is somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  This is because no-one lives outside of a community and no community is outside of a greater society that has unconscious biases and values based on a legacy of prejudice- values that we refuse to revisit and deliberate upon.  That society and the community contributes alot to the circumstances and opportunity any younger person has.  Of course, individuals have self-determination, but we cannot get very far these days witout others. No one exists in a vacuum and these young people especialy are made to rely on others as a result of society's given limitations and some self-limitations (age at the very least) as well.  At the end of the day, every person is an individual, young people especially.  I don't think its so helpful to collectivize these individuals because they are naturally under the care of others, especially when they may be living in a moment when they are most themselves- less forced to be who they are not.  Instead we should have different words to describe our- our community the one we have a right to label (perhaps this is a good time to think about what you think community is and of which communities you are a part), and our society. </p>
    
    <p> Are we an opportunity society?</p>
    
    <p> Is our society/community at-risk of losing sight of what is important, of what are values are or even having them?</p?
    
    <p> Are we disadvantaged by the structure of our made-environments, to see what makes a society great?</p>
    
    <p> I will end this post with a repeating a remark (to the best of my memory) the Louisiana Center for Children's Rights Director, Josh Perry quoted: "we are best able to measure the health ouf our society by the way we treat our most vulnerable citizens."  How do we treat the most vulnerable?  Who is the most vulnerable?  And when are you vulnerable?</p>
